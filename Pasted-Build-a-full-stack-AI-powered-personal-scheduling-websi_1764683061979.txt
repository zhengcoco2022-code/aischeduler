Build a full-stack AI-powered personal scheduling website with the following requirements:

1. General Description

Create a clean, modern web app that automatically generates a personalized, healthy, realistic daily and weekly schedule for the user.
Users should upload their class schedule (as an image), enter tasks, deadlines, and workload, and the AI should intelligently fill all free time slots with the tasks in a practical, manageable way.

2. Schedule Input (Upload)

Provide a component where the user can upload a screenshot or photo of their class schedule.

Use OCR to extract:

class names

start & end times

days of the week

Convert this into a structured timetable format stored in the backend.

3. Task Input

Provide a task-creation panel where the user can add:

task name

expected duration

deadline

priority level

category (school, workout, personal, health, etc.)

4. AI Scheduling Engine

Build an AI function that:

analyzes the extracted class schedule

finds all open/free time blocks

places tasks into the best available slots

ensures:

tasks have enough time to be fully completed

schedule remains healthy (reasonable work hours, breaks included)

workload is spread realistically across days

urgent tasks appear earlier

long tasks are split into multiple manageable sessions

sleep time (user-defined or default 11pm–7am) is protected

5. Output Format

Generate a clean weekly calendar view that shows:

extracted class schedule

added tasks placed into free blocks

time-block color coding

ability to rearrange tasks manually (drag + drop)

Also provide:

a “Regenerate Schedule” button

a “Download schedule as PDF” option

6. Additional Features (fill them in creatively)

Add several smart features, including:

Task health recommendations (if schedule is overloaded, warn user)

Automatic break insertion

Focus session timer (Pomodoro option)

Daily summary page (tasks completed, remaining, ETA)

Sync with Google Calendar (optional)

7. Technical Requirements

Use React (or Next.js) for the frontend.

Use Python/Node backend for OCR + scheduling logic.

Use a simple database (SQLite, Supabase, or Replit DB).

UI should be clean, minimalistic, and aesthetic.

All code must be included in the Replit project.

8. AI Model Integration

Use an LLM (Replit AI or other available models) to:

interpret schedule screenshot

reason about task placement

justify and adjust the final schedule
